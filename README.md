### For developers ###
Currently, I'm in the process of picking the license for this project. But for now, you are free to enjoy modifying the code as much as you want. 

Also, you can contribute to this project by testing it on older versions of OS X. As noted above, I've only tested it on OS X Mavericks with Xcode 5.

**Be noted**, you are allow to use only the decolorized version of icon, logo and background artwork of MPlayerScreenSaverX, which are already in the git repository. The colorized version are only distributed with the official released version of MPlayerScreenSaverX, which can be found in the [Downloads](https://bitbucket.org/iAmMutun/mplayerscreensaverx/downloads) page. You are *not* allow to use the colorized version in your build or any other ways without my permission.
