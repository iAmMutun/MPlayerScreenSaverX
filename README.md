## Save your Mac screen with any video files you want! ##

MPlayerScreenSaverX is powered by [MPlayer](http://www.mplayerhq.hu), one of the most powerful and open source media players for OS X. This means MPlayerScreenSaverX is capable of open almost any media files and play it out on your Mac screen as a screen saver!

### Download ###
You can go to the [Releases](https://github.com/iAmMutun/MPlayerScreenSaverX/releases) page and grab the latest stable version!

Currently, MPlayerScreenSaverX has only been tested on OS X Yosemite, but it should works on a few versions back.

### For developers ###
Currently, I'm in the process of picking the license for this project. But for now, you are free to enjoy modifying the code as much as you want. 

Also, you can contribute to this project by testing it on older versions of OS X. As noted above, I've only tested it on OS X Yosemite with Xcode 6.

**Be noted**, you are allow to use only the decolorized version of the artworks (icon, logo, and background) of MPlayerScreenSaverX, which are already in the git repository. The colorized version artworks are only distributed with the official released version of MPlayerScreenSaverX, which can be found in the [Releases](https://github.com/iAmMutun/MPlayerScreenSaverX/releases) page. You are *not* allow to use the colorized version in your build or any other ways without my permission.
