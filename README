Building MPlayerScreenSaverX
----------------------------
There are two ways to build MPlayerScreenSaverX:
1. Run `xcodebuild` in Terminal to build the project with default settings. Or,
2. Open MPlayerScreenSaverX.xcodeproj with Xcode to build the project with GUI.



Getting MPlayer source code
---------------------------
A pre-compiled version of MPlayer excutable is already packed with the project.
If you need the source code, run the commands below in Terminal:

cd mplayer
./get-mplayer

This will run the get-mplayer script, which then download the source code for
MPlayer version 1.1.1 from http://mplayerhq.hu/. The file libvo/vo_corevideo.m
will also be automaticly patched, according to the bug report found on MacPorts
website at http://trac.macports.org/ticket/40914.

If you want to build MPlayer with the same optimized configuration I used, run:

./configure-mpssx
cd MPlayer-1.1.1
make

Note that you may need to download and build other additional libraries first.

Once the build finished, you can then copy the MPlayer binary excutable to the
project directory with the command:

cp mplayer ../../MPlayerScreenSaverX/
