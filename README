Building MPlayerScreenSaverX
----------------------------
There are two ways to build MPlayerScreenSaverX:
1. Run `xcodebuild` in Terminal to build the project with default settings. Or,
2. Open MPlayerScreenSaverX.xcodeproj with Xcode to build the project with GUI.



Getting MPlayer source code
---------------------------
A pre-built version of MPlayer excutable is already packed with the project.
To get the same source code I used to build MPlayer, run:

cd mplayer
./get-mplayer
./configure
make

The ./get-mplayer script will download the source code for MPlayer version 1.1.1
from http://mplayerhq.hu/. The driver files vo_corevideo.m/vo_corevideo.h in the
libvo/ directory will then be patched with the same files from niltshâ€™s version
of MPlayer for MPlayerX, which can be found on GitHub.

The ./configure script will configure MPlayer with the same configuration I used.
Finally, running make to built the MPlayer.

Note that you may need to download and build other additional libraries first.

Once the build finished, you can then copy the MPlayer binary excutable to the
project directory with the command:

make install

Thanks to niltsh (https://github.com/niltsh) on GitHub for creating MPlayerX
(http://mplayerx.org). MPlayerScreenSaverX is largely influenced and inspired by
him and his project.
